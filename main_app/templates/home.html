        To get started, make an account and set up a profile. From there,
        connect with friends by making an event, or responding to a friends
        event and let them know you'll be going. If you have a suggestion to
        the events creator, post a comment and let them know your thoughts.
        You can even respond to comments on an event, and tell other people
        that you think their idea is stupid.
